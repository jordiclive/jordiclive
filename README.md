<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋</h1>

- 🧑‍💻 I'm currently a Lead Deep Learning Scientist at **[Chattermill](https://chattermill.com/)**, previously a Research Engineer at Ontocord.ai.

- 🌍 I conduct Machine Learning Research for **[LAION](https://laion.ai/)** (Stability AI) on the Ezra-1 UltraCluster, LUMI, and JUWELS supercomputers; previously worked for [BigScience](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop) (the BLOOM evaluation), and the open-source chat agent [OpenAssistant](https://open-assistant.io/team).

- 📝 I'm an **active contributor** to machine learning libraries such as **MMTEB**, **GEM-benchmark** and **Hugging Face Transformers**, 

- 🔭 I’m currently focusing on insight agents, fine-tuned "Smol" LLMs, retrieval, LLM application evaluation and semantic search—embedding-based models and their evaluation ([MTEB](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb)).

- 🎓 I earned my Masters in Machine Learning & A.I at **Imperial College London**, specializing in natural language generation and collaborating with Google DeepMind.

- 💬 I occasionally speak at the NLP study group, the most popular NLP community on Meetup.com, where we discuss SoTA methods .
